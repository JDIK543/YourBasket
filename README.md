# YourBasket
Your Basket is an app developed by Brandon Lara, Ikaika Lee, Anthony Vuong, Adam Dupuy, Christian Johnson, and I. It is a cooking app 
that allows users to add food-items to their inventory by scanning the barcode. The app then recommends recipes based on what is in 
the user's inventory. It also includes a favoriting feature and a way to add ingredients of a recipe to a shopping list.
